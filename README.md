# SwiftTranslator Playwright Tests

Automated **Playwright tests** for [SwiftTranslator](https://www.swifttranslator.com/) website, covering **positive functional, negative functional, and UI tests** for Singlish to Sinhala translation.

Tests run **headless by default**, with an HTML report to view results locally.

4. 🧪 Running Tests

Run all tests (headless):

Run specific test suites

Positive functional tests:
```bash
